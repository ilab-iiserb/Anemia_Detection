# Anemia_Detection
A MATLAB code for detecting the presence of anemia in users and is meant to be run on the mobile version of MATLAB. The method is based on blob detection algorithm and employs many other techniques to provide an accurate output. Leukonychia is an indicator of iron deficiency anemia, and this is detected using an image analysis technique. We can detect anemia with an accuracy of 89% just by analyzing the photograph of nails from an individual; one can diagnose the early onset of anemia. This method demonstrates a low margin of error and high sensitivity of 96% compared to prior arts indicating its usability as an on-site detection technique.
